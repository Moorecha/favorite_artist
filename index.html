He also adopted the new stage name of <u>Playboi Carti</u>. He joined the underground Atlanta label ‘Awful Records’ and later switched to ASAP Rocky's ‘AWGE’. Currently under contract with the major record label ‘Interscope’, an imprint of Interscope Geffen A&M Records, Carti released his mixtape ‘Playboi Carti’ in 2017 which peaked at the 12th position on the US Billboard 200.Playboi Carti also has a unique style which distinguishes him from others. Upon his style, GO has said <b>“leader of a youth style,”</b> and he represents a stylistic midpoint between the “fashion gloss of A$AP Mob, the punk-rock attitude of Uzi Vert, and the playful cap of Yachty. RAF Simons and Balmain are in his favorite brands’ list. He met Simons in New York at a fashion show. And his featured song with A$AO Mob, RAF was dedicated to the RAF Simons brands. Playboi Carter <u>has modeled several times</u> which includes Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 5, VFiles and Drake’s OVO Lookbook. </p>
